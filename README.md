UX friendly Cloud UI for all Clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Open Source Cloud Console

Consoles as of today is closed sourced, even though they do use publicly available API of cloud services. We're building the next great Cloud Console, and it starts here. Right now this is only a short intro of what the service could be. And while there are some alternatives this one focuses on application services connecting the cloud resources together. You'll get an application first solution rather than cloud infrastructure first which isn't very useful.
